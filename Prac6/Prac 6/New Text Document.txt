input data to present to the network: train_X
target data defining desired network output: lables
Samples are Matrix rows

Number of Hidden Neurons: 10

Train using scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation(trainscg)
Training automatically stops when generalization stops improving, as indicated by an increase in the cross-entropy error of the validation samples.

Training multiple times will generate different results due to different initial conditons and sampling.

Minimizing Cross-Entropy results in good classification.
Lower values are better. Zero means no error.
